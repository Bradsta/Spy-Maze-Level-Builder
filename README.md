# Spy-Maze-Level-Builder
I did not use a game engine to create Spy Maze, therefore I created a handy level builder application to help me and my father design levels for the game.

If anyone who sees this is interested in testing it out for fun, the executable program can be found on my dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zq9bi0keruenpi3/Spy%20Maze%20Level%20Builder.zip?dl=0
